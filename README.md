# ImpactLens: COVID-19 Global Dashboard
Pandemic Pulse: Global Analysis provides an in-depth and interactive exploration of the COVID-19 pandemic's extensive impact across the globe. This Power BI project integrates and synthesizes data from diverse sources, including the World Health Organization (WHO), Johns Hopkins University (JHU), Our World in Data, and other authoritative entities, to deliver a comprehensive overview of the pandemic’s effects.

The project is structured into several key analytical areas:

Global Overview: Aggregates global and regional data on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries, supplemented with a timeline of significant milestones and events.

Regional Insights: Utilizes heat maps and trend analyses to illustrate the pandemic’s spread and impact across various regions, revealing geographical variations and trends.

Healthcare System Analysis: Examines critical metrics related to healthcare systems, including hospital bed occupancy, ICU utilization, and accessibility to treatments and vaccines.

Economic Impact: Analyzes shifts in economic indicators such as GDP, unemployment rates, and disruptions across various sectors, highlighting the pandemic’s economic repercussions.

Socio-Economic Effects: Assesses the broader societal impacts, including educational disruptions, mental health trends, and general socio-economic challenges.

Vaccine Distribution: Tracks and visualizes vaccine distribution rates, coverage, and logistical challenges, providing insights into vaccination efforts and progress.

Policy Response: Maps out government policies and their effects, including lockdowns, travel restrictions, and economic stimulus measures, along with public compliance and its impact on pandemic control.

Long-term Recovery: Monitors ongoing recovery trends and identifies lessons learned to enhance future pandemic preparedness and response strategies.

Pandemic Pulse: Global Analysis combines data from multiple sources to offer a unified, interactive dashboard that facilitates a nuanced understanding of the pandemic’s global impact. By employing Power BI’s advanced visualization tools, the project enables users to explore data dynamically, uncover critical insights, and engage with the complex realities of the pandemic's effects.
