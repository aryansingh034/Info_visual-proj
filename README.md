# Pandemic Pulse: Global Analysis

**Pandemic Pulse: Global Analysis** provides an in-depth and interactive exploration of the COVID-19 pandemic's extensive impact across the globe. This Power BI project integrates and synthesizes data from diverse sources to deliver a comprehensive overview of the pandemic’s effects.

## Project Overview

The project leverages data from authoritative sources, including the World Health Organization (WHO), Johns Hopkins University (JHU), Our World in Data, and others, to analyze various dimensions of the pandemic. The analysis is organized into several key areas:

1. **Global Overview**
   - Aggregates global and regional data on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries.
   - Includes a timeline of significant milestones and events.

2. **Regional Insights**
   - Utilizes heat maps and trend analyses to illustrate the pandemic’s spread and impact across various regions.
   - Reveals geographical variations and trends.

3. **Healthcare System Analysis**
   - Examines critical metrics related to healthcare systems, including hospital bed occupancy, ICU utilization, and treatment accessibility.

4. **Economic Impact**
   - Analyzes shifts in economic indicators such as GDP, unemployment rates, and sector-specific disruptions.
   - Highlights the pandemic’s economic repercussions.

5. **Socio-Economic Effects**
   - Assesses broader societal impacts, including educational disruptions, mental health trends, and general socio-economic challenges.

6. **Vaccine Distribution**
   - Tracks and visualizes vaccine distribution rates, coverage, and logistical challenges.
   - Provides insights into vaccination efforts and progress.

7. **Policy Response**
   - Maps out government policies and their effects, including lockdowns, travel restrictions, and economic stimulus measures.
   - Includes public compliance and its impact on pandemic control.

8. **Long-term Recovery**
   - Monitors ongoing recovery trends and identifies lessons learned for future pandemic preparedness and response strategies.
